overview of the project 
project: STUDENT GRADE TRACKER using python 
objective:
The objective of creating a student grade tracker using Python is to develop a program that helps students, teachers, or administrators manage and track student grades efficiently. The key objectives for this project could include:

Recording Student Information: Allow users to input and store information about students, such as their names, student IDs, and possibly other relevant details like class or section.

Tracking Grades: Enable users to input and update grades for each student across different assignments, tests, or exams.
key activities:
The key activities involved in developing a student grade tracker using Python include:

User Input and Data Management:

Prompting the user to input student information such as names, student IDs, and possibly other details like class or section.
Storing this information efficiently, such as in data structures like dictionaries, lists, or objects.
Grade Tracking and Calculation:

Allowing users to input and update grades for each student across different assignments, tests, or exams.
Calculating averages or other metrics based on the grades entered for individual assignments or exams.
Reporting and Analysis:

Generating reports, such as grade summaries or progress reports, for individual students or entire classes.
Optionally, providing analysis tools to identify trends or patterns in student performance.
Data Persistence:

Implementing features to save student information and grades persistently, such as in a file or a database, to ensure that data is not lost when the program is closed.
User Interface:

Creating a user-friendly interface, either through the console or a graphical user interface (GUI), to allow users to interact with the program easily.
This may involve displaying menus, prompts, and reports in a clear and understandable format.
Error Handling and Validation:

Handling invalid inputs or errors gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
Validating user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent unintended behavior.
Scalability and Flexibility:

Designing the program to scale with the number of students and assignments.
Allowing flexibility to accommodate different grading systems and criteria.
Security and Access Control (Optional):

Implementing security measures such as user authentication and access control if the grade tracker contains sensitive information.
Testing and Debugging:

Testing the program thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Ensuring that the program functions correctly under various scenarios and edge cases.
Documentation and Support:

Providing documentation or user guides to help users understand how to use the grade tracker effectively.
Offering support and assistance to users in case they encounter any difficulties or have questions about the program.
